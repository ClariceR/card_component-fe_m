### What I learned

This challenge was great to practice making a responsive card layout. I tried to solve it without giving fixed sizes as much as I could. 

I learned that we can use more than one background "image" in the same property, separating them with commas. However, we can't add a solid color, so the way I achieved the overlay effect was using a linear gradient, repeating the same colour with transparency. I thought that was pretty cool.

I also enjoyed choosing the way the image would resize, because in this case, it was more interesting kepping the face of the lady who is smilling always visible. 

Another aspect that I really enjoyed was using the BEM approach to my classes. I will be focused on learning and improving with this method from now on.

When adding border radius to the card, the image covers the corners. One way to fix that is applying overflow hidden to the card.

I could see really quickily that althoug using inherit for box-sizing is good, using inherit for margin is a terrible idea ðŸ˜†

### Continued development

I'm interested in getting more practice with BEM and also looking into concepts like OOCSS.
Also, I want to make the final product accessible and respecting users preferences.

### Useful resources

- [Tinted image](https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/) - I learned how to do the tinted image with this article.
- [Fluid font size](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) - I've ended up not using this, but it seems an interesting thing to try out.
